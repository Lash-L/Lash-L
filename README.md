Stats for custom integrations were found [here](https://analytics.home-assistant.io/custom_integrations.json)

Home Assistant analytics are opt-in and as Home Assistant caters to users who are very privacy conscious, it is estimated
only around 1/3 of users have opted into analytics. So to get a more accurate number of users, we multiply the number of
users by 3. As well, out of the users who have opted into analytics, only 80% of them have opted into integration analytics
so we divide the original number of users by 0.8 to get a more accurate number of users.
